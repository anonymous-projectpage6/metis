<section>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Model merging has emerged as a practical post-training paradigm for constructing
    a single multi-task large language model by combining task-specialized models.
    However, most existing approaches rely on post-hoc one-shot merging,
    which often suffers from <em>information erasure</em> caused by task interference.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this work, we show that replacing post-hoc merging with an iterative
    <strong>many-shot merging</strong> protocol significantly improves multi-task capability
    by reducing abrupt parameter shifts.
    Building on this insight, we propose <strong>MS-LAC</strong>,
    a loss-aware many-shot merging method that stabilizes iterative integration
    via task-wise loss-gap weighting and consensus-based masking.
  </p>

<!-- ================= MOTIVATION ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Why Many-Shot Merging?</h3>

  <img src="assets/intro_manyshot.png" class="figure">

  <p>
    Post-hoc merging aggregates independently trained task models only once,
    inducing abrupt cross-task interference and severe information erasure.
    In contrast, many-shot merging integrates task-specific models iteratively,
    enabling gradual adaptation to heterogeneous task objectives.
  </p>

<!-- ================= EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Empirical Evidence</h3>

  <img src="assets/loss_posthoc_manyshot.png" class="figure">

  <p>
    Simply transitioning from post-hoc to many-shot merging consistently reduces
    multi-task loss and improves normalized performance across representative
    merging methods, including TaskArithmetic, DARE, TIES, and ConsensusTA.
  </p>

<!-- ================= METHOD OVERVIEW ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Method Overview: MS-LAC</h3>

  <img src="assets/proposed_framework.png" class="figure">

  <p>
    MS-LAC operates within the many-shot merging framework and introduces two key
    mechanisms to mitigate information erasure during iterative integration.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Loss-Gap-Aware Weighting:</strong>
      Rebalances task contributions by prioritizing tasks whose performance
      deteriorates most after merging.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consensus-Based Masking:</strong>
      Localizes compatible parameter updates and suppresses conflicting task signals.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= MANY-SHOT VS POST-HOC ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Post-hoc vs. Many-shot Merging</h3>

  <img src="assets/proposed_manyshotframework.png" class="figure">

  <p>
    Unlike post-hoc merging, which aggregates fully trained task models in a single step,
    many-shot merging repeatedly alternates between local adaptation and merging,
    constraining task drift and enabling stable multi-task optimization.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= RESULTS ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Results</h3>

  <img src="assets/loss_posthoc_manyshot.png" class="figure">

  <p>
    MS-LAC consistently outperforms both post-hoc and many-shot baselines,
    achieving the highest average normalized performance across backbone models.
    Notably, it significantly improves performance on the worst-performing task,
    demonstrating strong robustness to information erasure.
  </p>

<!-- ================= TASK-LEVEL ANALYSIS ================= -->
<section>
  <h3>Balanced Task-Level Performance</h3>

  <img src="assets/task_radar_posthoc.png" class="figure">

  <p>
    Radar plots across multiple backbone LLMs show that MS-LAC maintains
    balanced performance across instruction following, mathematical reasoning,
    multilingual understanding, and safety, without severe degradation on any task.
