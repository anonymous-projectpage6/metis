<!-- Abstract -->
<section>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Model merging is a practical post-training strategy for constructing a single
    multi-task LLM by combining task-specialized models. However, most existing
    approaches rely on post-hoc one-shot merging, which often suffers from
    <em>information erasure</em> caused by task interference.
  </p>
  <p>
    We show that replacing post-hoc merging with an iterative
    <strong>many-shot merging</strong> protocol significantly improves multi-task
    capability by reducing abrupt parameter shifts.
    Building on this insight, we propose <strong>MS-LAC</strong>,
    a loss-aware many-shot merging method that stabilizes iterative integration
    via task-wise loss-gap weighting and consensus-based masking.

<!-- Motivation -->
<section>
  <h3>Why Many-Shot Merging?</h3>
  <img src="assets/manyshot_vs_posthoc.png" class="figure">
  <p>
    One-shot post-hoc merging introduces abrupt cross-task interference,
    leading to severe information erasure.
    Many-shot merging mitigates this issue by gradually integrating
    task-specific models across rounds.

  <h3>Method: MS-LAC</h3>
  <img src="assets/framework.png" class="figure">

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Many-shot merging:</strong> iterative task integration over multiple rounds</li>
    <li><strong>Loss-gap-aware weighting:</strong> prioritizes underperforming tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Consensus-based masking:</strong> localizes compatible parameter updates</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <img src="assets/results.png" class="figure">
  <p>
    MS-LAC consistently outperforms post-hoc and many-shot baselines,
    achieving higher average performance and significantly improving
    the worst-performing task.
